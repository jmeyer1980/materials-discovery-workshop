# Mitigation guidance for each blacklisted element
mitigation_guidance:
  Be: |
    **Beryllium (Be) - EXTREME HAZARD**
    - **Toxicity**: Highly toxic, causes chronic beryllium disease (CBD) and lung cancer
    - **Risk Level**: Cannot be safely handled in most laboratory settings
    - **Required Controls**: Full containment, respiratory protection, specialized facilities
    - **Recommendation**: Do not synthesize. Use alternative materials without beryllium.
    - **Override Requirements**: PI approval, radiation safety officer clearance, specialized containment plan

  Hg: |
    **Mercury (Hg) - HIGH TOXICITY**
    - **Toxicity**: Neurotoxic, bioaccumulative, affects nervous system and kidneys
    - **Risk Level**: Extremely dangerous in vapor form, persistent environmental contaminant
    - **Required Controls**: Fume hood, mercury vapor detector, proper waste disposal
    - **Recommendation**: Avoid unless mercury-specific properties are absolutely required
    - **Override Requirements**: Environmental health & safety approval, mercury handling certification

  Cd: |
    **Cadmium (Cd) - CARCINOGENIC**
    - **Toxicity**: Carcinogenic, causes bone and kidney damage, long half-life in body
    - **Risk Level**: OSHA regulated carcinogen, requires strict controls
    - **Required Controls**: Local exhaust ventilation, respiratory protection, biological monitoring
    - **Recommendation**: Substitute with less toxic elements where possible
    - **Override Requirements**: Carcinogen handling permit, medical surveillance program

  Pb: |
    **Lead (Pb) - NEUROTOXIC**
    - **Toxicity**: Neurotoxic, especially to developing brains, bioaccumulative
    - **Risk Level**: Particularly dangerous for pregnant workers and children
    - **Required Controls**: Engineering controls, PPE, air monitoring, medical surveillance
    - **Recommendation**: Use lead-free alternatives for most applications
    - **Override Requirements**: Lead safety program compliance, blood lead monitoring

  As: |
    **Arsenic (As) - HIGHLY TOXIC**
    - **Toxicity**: Carcinogenic, causes skin lesions, cardiovascular disease
    - **Risk Level**: Extremely toxic, multiple routes of exposure
    - **Required Controls**: Containment, PPE, air monitoring, waste treatment
    - **Recommendation**: Avoid arsenic-containing materials unless essential
    - **Override Requirements**: Toxic substances handling certification, environmental permits

  Tl: |
    **Thallium (Tl) - EXTREMELY TOXIC**
    - **Toxicity**: Extremely toxic, causes hair loss, nerve damage, death
    - **Risk Level**: One of the most toxic elements, no safe threshold
    - **Required Controls**: Full containment, specialized handling procedures
    - **Recommendation**: Never synthesize thallium compounds in standard labs
    - **Override Requirements**: Extremely restricted - requires specialized toxicology approval

  Sb: |
    **Antimony (Sb) - TOXIC**
    - **Toxicity**: Causes respiratory irritation, potential carcinogen
    - **Risk Level**: Moderate toxicity, requires ventilation controls
    - **Required Controls**: Fume hood, respiratory protection
    - **Recommendation**: Use with caution, monitor exposure
    - **Override Requirements**: Industrial hygiene approval

  Bi: |
    **Bismuth (Bi) - LOW TOXICITY**
    - **Toxicity**: Generally low toxicity, but can cause bismuth encephalopathy in rare cases
    - **Risk Level**: Low risk for most applications
    - **Required Controls**: Standard laboratory practices
    - **Recommendation**: Generally safe, but monitor for unusual exposures
    - **Override Requirements**: Standard safety protocols
